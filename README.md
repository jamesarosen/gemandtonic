## What is it?

Gem & Tonic is a web application that watches [Rubygems](http://rubygems.org) for gem updates and notifies developers of changes to their dependencies.

## How it works

1. Go to [http://gemandtonic.com](http://gemandtonic.com)
1. Click "Sign In," be redirected to Rubygems.org to allow access
1. If you're not signed in to Rubygems.org, sign in
1. Accept the connection between Rubygems.org and Gem & Tonic
1. Upload one or more `Gemfile`s to Gem & Tonic
1. Gem & Tonic will notify you when a dependency changes on Rubygems.org
